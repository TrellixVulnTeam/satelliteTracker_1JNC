			<p><span class="tab">Scroll on the satellite or groundsite list to view all selectable options</span></p>
			<p><span class="tab">Click on the checkbox next to a satellite or groundsite name to turn that
			satellite's path or groundsite location on or off</span></p>
			<p><span class="tab">Scroll with the mouse to zoom in and out</span></p>

			<p>About:</p>
			<p><span class="tab">This project tracks 100 different satellites in their orbits around the earth,
			with 10 groundsites on the earth's surface. The point of the project is to visualize
			satellite paths in 3D, while also showing where those paths are visible to different
			points on the earth.</span></p>
			<p><span class="tab">The application allows for the user to select and view satellite orbits, and
			the path shown is a 12 hour snapshot of the satellite's future path.
			A ground site can also be selected to show where a satellite's orbit will be
			visible to that location on the earth. The project also uses a shader to show day and night on the 
			earth.</span></p>
			<p><span class="tab">Some of the orbits, especially high earth orbits, will look a little odd, and 
			this is expected. This globe doesn't rotate independently beneath the satellites. Because of this, 
			the orbits may look different than expected as they stay accurate to which parts of the earth they 
			are above at given times. It would look more like what we are used to when viewing a 3D orbit had I 
			opted to create an elliptical path for each satellite based on the TLE information gathered. Because 
			the purpose of the project was to use the TLE data for each satellite to show as accurately as possible 
			where each satellite will be in relation to the earth's surface, I opted for what you see now. This was 
			also more interesting to work with.</span></p>
